This folder contains the new concept set and the new data, a direct excerpt from TBL. What still needs to be done here:

* refine the language names (break them down)
* apply their groupings (we have them somewhere, can extract them in csv)
* tokenize and pre-segmentize the entries, discard nullege entries
* make an initial parse on cognate judgments
* add the data to the stdb (retain old data, but maybe clean it in parts, especially make sure that overlapping languages are now deleted)
* refine the app, so that the concepts that are selected as a default are the 260 ones, and that we have things like ("Swadesh100") as prioritizing possibilities (map stuff to concepticon!)

That's all for now, but more needs to be done!

Laurent's comments
==================

Concerning newly-added items:
Some animal names appear in your list under 'animals', others under 'nature'. The frog appears twice. Perhaps others too, I haven't checked systematically.
The crow is too onomatopoetic. Should remove.
We don't need 'soup'. Not clear what it is, too many kinds.
Should remove 'pond', keep 'lake'
'to cook' is too vague;  Boil, steam, fry, bake ? remove.
Among domesticated animals, while old domesticates are very informative, domesticates that are very recent in Asia like the rabbit, goose and cat probably add very little. I'm for removing them. 

Plant domesticates: the peach, grape, should be removed. Also the vegetable.

The bedbug: Normally it's Cimex lectularius but it's not at all certain that investigators are not recording the name of the bed louse or th ename of the stinkbug. Tibetan loanword in many languages. I'd drop that. 

The monkey: there are many kinds and not sure there was a generic term in PST. Drop.
The sea: most of the languages we're interested in are not near the sea. Forget.

Verbs:
'to wash' corresponds to too many words depending on what is being washed (body, face, clothes, dishes etc.) Replace with 'wash (the body/the hands)'
'to cut' also too many verbs depending on what is being cut and how. Remove.
'to open' also too many verbs. Disambiguate as 'open (the door)'
'To plant' a pole in the ground ? a tree ? beans ? disambiguate as 'to plant (seeds)'
To swallow: disambiguate as 'to sawllow (solids)'

Items that I think we should definitely add:

bodyparts: body hair, brain, lip, ribs

animals 
the wild dog, or dhole, Cuon alpinus
​the nit
the flea​
​the horse

​Numerals:
add 'hundred'
​'some' is a difficult translation problem.​ Should remove

​Metal names 'copper' and 'iron' are borrowed in most cases. They're just adding noise.​


We need to disambiguate some items:
The breast: female or general ?
The hair: 'the head hair' ?
The rice: plant ? grains ? with or without the envelopes ? cooked or not ? I think we should keep the rice plant.
difference between 'warm (hot)' and 'hot' ? must choose one
The bull: that means the male of Bos taurus. if you mean the name of the species, it's the ox (French boeuf).
To fall: > fall down from a height, of things. Not:  fall to the ground, of people.
