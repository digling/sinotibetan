# Further Steps

## Concept Mapping with TBL and ZMYYC and CIHUI

* produce automatically mapped list between our data and TBL
* re-check and re-identify the missing concepts

## Segmentation

segmentation of dialect entries in two stages:

- make automatic segmentation
- correct the automatic segmentation manually

## Meta-Data Managment

- managing biographic lists (Pinyin with tone marks, translation)
- managing languages / doculects: full names, linking sources, adding geographic positions, mapping with glottolog and ethnologue (if possible)
